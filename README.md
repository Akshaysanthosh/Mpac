Mpac â€“ Self driving RC Vechile Platform using Machine learning and Opensource Hardware


Mpac  is a hardware software platform for RC  cars . This project consist of both hardware and machine learning backend that make autonomous driving possible by using sensor data in real time and user behaviour pattern of a specific location . Its hardware analysis the obstacle , path etc from the sensor data and feed it t a neural network and it creates a model which form the output and helps in autonomous driving
